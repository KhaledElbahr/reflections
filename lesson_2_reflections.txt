What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A hidden file is created called .git which will has a history of all files if  you make commits.
To track the files you committed in the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
staging area works as intermediate layer between the working directory and the repository, it allows us to make changes such as add/remove files before call commit to repository.
